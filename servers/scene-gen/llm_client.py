    # Construct the prompt for Claude
    prompt = f"""You are an expert architect and interior designer. Analyze this description and generate an appropriate layout: "{input_text}"

STEP 1: ANALYZE REQUEST TYPE
First determine if the user is asking for:
- SINGLE ROOM: Only one specific room (e.g., "design a living room", "create a bedroom", "generate a kitchen")
- MULTIPLE ROOMS: A complete layout, house, apartment, or multiple connected rooms

STEP 2: GENERATE APPROPRIATE LAYOUT
For SINGLE ROOM requests:
- Generate just that one room with appropriate dimensions
- Include doors and windows suitable for that room type
- Position the room at coordinates (0, 0, 0)
- Use realistic proportions for the specific room type
- Consider the room's intended function and furniture layout
- Example single room dimensions: living room (4.5×6m), bedroom (3.5×4m), kitchen (3×4m)

For MULTIPLE ROOMS requests:
- Create a functional, well-designed layout that considers:
  - Architectural best practices and building codes
  - Natural light and ventilation
  - Traffic flow and accessibility
  - Room adjacencies and relationships
  - Realistic proportions and dimensions

EXAMPLES OF REQUEST TYPES:
SINGLE ROOM: "design a master bedroom", "create a modern kitchen", "living room with fireplace"
MULTIPLE ROOMS: "2 bedroom apartment", "small house", "office layout", "3 bedroom home"

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object using this exact structure:

```json
{{
    "building_style": "description of architectural style (e.g., Modern residential, Traditional colonial, etc.)",
    "rooms": [
        {{
            "room_type": "specific room type (e.g., living room, master bedroom, kitchen, etc.)",
            "dimensions": {{"width": float, "length": float, "height": float}},
            "position": {{"x": float, "y": float, "z": 0}},
            "doors": [

                }}
            ]
        }}
    ]
}}
```

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- For SINGLE ROOM: Include exactly 1 room in the "rooms" array
- For MULTIPLE ROOMS: Include all rooms in the "rooms" array with proper layout
- Use metric dimensions (meters)
- Standard ceiling height: 2.7m (can vary for special rooms)
- Door dimensions: height 2.0-2.1m, width 0.7-1.0m
- Window sill heights: 0.9-1.1m typically
- position_on_wall: 0.0-1.0 (fraction along wall length)
- For single rooms: position at (0,0,0) and focus on room functionality
- For multiple rooms: arrange logically without overlaps and ensure connectivity
- Include appropriate doors for room access and flow
- Place windows for natural light and views
- Consider the specific requirements mentioned in the description

Generate a layout that truly reflects the input description with appropriate room types, sizes, and relationships."""

    # Construct the prompt for Claude - ROOMS ONLY
    prompt = f"""You are an expert architect and interior designer. Analyze this description and generate an appropriate ROOM LAYOUT (rooms and walls only, NO doors or windows): "{input_text}"

🚨 CRITICAL LAYOUT CONSTRAINTS 🚨
- **ABSOLUTELY NO OVERLAPPING ROOMS**: Room boundaries must NEVER intersect or overlap
- **NO ISOLATED ROOMS**: Every room must be adjacent to at least one other room for connectivity

STEP 1: ANALYZE REQUEST TYPE
First determine if the user is asking for:
- SINGLE ROOM: Only one specific room (e.g., "design a living room", "create a bedroom", "generate a kitchen")
- MULTIPLE ROOMS: A complete layout, house, apartment, or multiple connected rooms

STEP 2: GENERATE ROOM STRUCTURE ONLY
For SINGLE ROOM requests:
- Generate just that one room with appropriate rectangular vertices
- Position the room starting at coordinates (0, 0) as the first vertex
- Use realistic proportions for the specific room type
- Consider the room's intended function and furniture layout
- Example single room vertices: living room [(0,0), (0,6), (4.5,6), (4.5,0)], bedroom [(0,0), (0,4), (3.5,4), (3.5,0)]
- Vertices must form a perfect rectangle with 90-degree corners

For MULTIPLE ROOMS requests:
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure NO ROOM OVERLAPS and NO ISOLATED ROOMS using vertex-based checking
- **VERTEX CONSTRAINT**: When placing each new room, ensure NO vertex of the new room is inside any previously generated room's boundary
- Create a functional, well-designed layout that considers:
  - Architectural best practices and building codes
  - Natural light and ventilation
  - Traffic flow and accessibility
  - Room adjacencies and relationships (every room must touch at least one other room)
  - Realistic proportions using rectangular vertices
  - **VERIFY**: No room vertices are inside other rooms' boundaries
  - **VERIFY**: Every room is positioned adjacent to at least one other room
  - **VERIFY**: All rooms use perfect rectangular vertices with 90-degree corners

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the room structure (rectangular vertices, height) - NO doors or windows at this stage.

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object using this exact structure:

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{{
    "building_style": "description of architectural style (e.g., Modern residential, Traditional colonial, etc.)",
    "rooms": [
        {{
            "room_type": "specific room type (e.g., living room, master bedroom, kitchen, etc.)",
            "vertices": [
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}}
            ],
            "height": float
        }}
    ]
}}
```

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- For SINGLE ROOM: Include exactly 1 room in the "rooms" array
- For MULTIPLE ROOMS: Include all rooms in the "rooms" array with proper layout
- Use metric coordinates (meters) for all vertices
- Standard ceiling height: 2.7m (can vary for special rooms)  
- For single rooms: start vertices at (0,0) and focus on room functionality
- For multiple rooms: arrange rectangular vertices logically without overlaps and ensure rooms can be connected later
- **VERTICES FORMAT**: Each room must have exactly 4 vertices forming a perfect rectangle
- **VERTEX ORDERING**: List vertices in clockwise or counter-clockwise order around the rectangle
- **ABSOLUTELY NO OVERLAPPING ROOMS**: Ensure no room vertices are inside other rooms and no boundaries intersect
- **NO ISOLATED ROOMS**: Every room must be positioned so it can be connected to at least one other room via doors (adjacency is essential)
- **VERTEX-BASED CHECKING**: Verify each room's 4 vertices do not fall inside any other room's boundary
- 🚨 DOUBLE-CHECK: Before finalizing, verify NO vertex overlaps and NO isolated rooms 🚨
- DO NOT include doors or windows arrays - these will be added in a separate step
- Focus on creating a solid architectural foundation with proper rectangular room vertices and relationships

Generate a room-only layout that truly reflects the input description with appropriate room types, rectangular vertices, and spatial relationships.

🚨 FINAL REMINDER - THESE ARE MANDATORY 🚨
- **NO OVERLAPPING ROOMS**: Check that no room vertices are inside other rooms and no boundaries intersect
- **NO ISOLATED ROOMS**: Verify every room can connect to at least one other room
- **PERFECT RECTANGLES**: Every room must have exactly 4 vertices forming a rectangle with 90-degree corners"""

YOUR TASK:
Based on the floor plan image, data, and traffic flow analysis, provide door and window placement recommendations following these rules:

1. ENTRY DOOR (exactly one for the entire floor plan):
   - Must be placed on an exterior wall (room-exterior shared wall)
   - Follow the traffic flow analysis recommendations if available
   - Predict appropriate entry door material/style that matches the building aesthetic
   - Specify: room_index, wall_side, center_position (0.0-1.0), width, height, door_material (brief description)

2. CONNECTING DOORS (for room-room shared walls):
   - Place doors to connect rooms according to traffic flow requirements
   - Prioritize essential connections over optional ones
   - Only place on room-room shared walls (between two rooms)
   - Choose between physical doors or wide openings based on room function:
     * Use physical doors (opening=false) for: bedrooms, bathrooms, private offices, storage rooms
     * Use wide openings (opening=true) for: living room-kitchen, living room-dining, open-plan concepts
   - Predict appropriate door material/style based on room types and design aesthetics
   - Specify: shared_wall_index, center_position_on_shared_wall (0.0-1.0), width, height, opening (true/false), door_material (brief description)

3. WINDOWS (only on exterior walls):
   - Place on room-exterior shared walls only

IMPORTANT COLOR SELECTION GUIDANCE:
- Analyze the building style and room function before choosing colors
- For TRADITIONAL/CLASSIC buildings: Use warmer, earth-tone colors with natural wood frames
- For MODERN/CONTEMPORARY buildings: Use cooler, neutral colors with metal or painted frames
- For INDUSTRIAL buildings: Use darker, muted colors with metal frames
- Match glass tint to room privacy needs: bedrooms (subtle tints), bathrooms (privacy glass), living areas (clear)
- Ensure frame colors complement the overall architectural aesthetic
- Avoid repetitive color choices - vary colors appropriately across different rooms and window types

CONSTRAINTS:
- Entry door: width 0.8-1.2m, height 2.0-2.1m
- Interior doors: width 0.7-0.9m, height 2.0-2.1m  
- Wide openings: width 1.2-3.0m, height 2.0-2.4m (for open-plan connections)
- Windows: width 0.8-2.0m, height 1.0-1.8m, sill height 0.8-1.2m
- Window grid [nx, ny]: Define window pane layout (nx=horizontal panes, ny=vertical panes), examples:
  * Fixed/Picture: [1, 1] - single large pane
  * Slider: [2, 1] - two horizontal sliding panes
  * Hung: [1, 2] - two vertical stacked panes
  * Bay: [2, 2] to [3, 3] - multiple panes in grid
  * Casement: [1, 1] - single hinged pane
- Window appearance description: Brief description combining frame style and glass type, examples:
  * "classic white painted wooden window frame with frosted glass"
  * "modern black aluminum window frame with translucent glass panels"
  * "classic white window frame with frosted glass panels"
  * "classic natural wood grain window frame with frosted glass panes"
- Window colors: Generate contextually appropriate glass_color and frame_color as RGB values [0-255] based on:
  * BUILDING STYLE: Traditional/classic → warmer tones, Modern → cooler/neutral tones, Industrial → darker frames
  * ROOM FUNCTION: Bedrooms → softer tints, Kitchens → clear/bright, Bathrooms → privacy (frosted/tinted)
  * AESTHETIC HARMONY: Match building style and room character with meaningful color choices
  
  GLASS COLOR EXAMPLES (choose based on context):
  * Clear/Neutral: [245, 247, 250] (modern clear), [252, 251, 244] (warm clear)
  * Subtle Tints: [240, 248, 255] (alice blue), [176, 224, 230] (powder blue), [173, 216, 230] (light blue)
  * Privacy Glass: [199, 227, 225] (frosted blue glass), [184, 227, 233] (frosted powder blue), [192, 230, 235] (frosted light blue)
  * Colored Glass: [135, 206, 250] (sky blue), [166, 227, 224] (ice crystal blue), [200, 233, 238] (pale blue)
  
  FRAME COLOR EXAMPLES (choose based on style):
  * Natural Wood: [49, 36, 26] (dark walnut), [139, 97, 69] (dark oak), [60, 34, 24] (espresso)
  * Painted Wood: [252, 251, 244] (cream white), [64, 89, 71] (forest green), [71, 82, 107] (navy blue)
  * Metal Frames: [54, 69, 79] (charcoal), [191, 191, 191] (brushed aluminum), [115, 107, 97] (bronze)
  * Modern Colors: [89, 97, 107] (graphite), [255, 253, 228] (creamy white), [92, 62, 41] (antique oak)

- Keep doors/windows away from corners (position 0.1-0.9 range)
- Ensure no overlapping doors/windows on the same wall segment
- Consider furniture placement and room circulation

    prompt = f"""You are an expert architect and interior designer. I have an EXISTING ROOM LAYOUT and need you to add SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL ROOMS without overlapping or creating isolated rooms.

ORIGINAL USER REQUEST:
"{input_text.strip()}"

CONTEXT:
This existing layout was generated as part of fulfilling the above user request. However, some rooms from the original request could not be added due to collision or isolation issues. Your task is to add these remaining rooms while respecting the existing layout and maintaining the original design intent.

STEP 1: IDENTIFY ROOMS TO ADD
{rejected_rooms_text}

STEP 2: ANALYZE ROOM REQUIREMENTS
Before placing these rooms, carefully analyze the ORIGINAL USER REQUEST above to understand:
- What are the specific functional requirements for each room you need to add?
- What are the size expectations (compact, medium, large, spacious) for each room type?
- What are the connectivity and adjacency requirements mentioned in the original request?
- How should these rooms relate to the existing rooms in terms of circulation and privacy?
- What are the architectural style and design principles that should guide the placement?

STEP 3: PLACEMENT CONSTRAINTS
🚨 CRITICAL LAYOUT CONSTRAINTS 🚨
- **ABSOLUTELY NO OVERLAPPING ROOMS**: New room vertices must NEVER intersect or overlap with ALL existing rooms
- **NO ISOLATED ROOMS**: Every new room must be adjacent to at least one existing room OR another new room for connectivity
- **PERFECT RECTANGLES**: Every new room must have exactly 4 vertices forming a rectangle with 90-degree corners
- **FLEXIBLE COORDINATE SPACE**: Rooms can be placed at ANY coordinate location including NEGATIVE coordinates (x < 0, y < 0) if needed for optimal layout design

{existing_rooms_text}

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- **FULFILL ORIGINAL REQUEST**: Ensure the added rooms serve the functions and relationships described in the original user request
- **VERTEX-BASED PLACEMENT**: Position new rooms so NO vertex falls inside ALL existing room boundaries
- **ADJACENCY REQUIRED**: Each new room must touch at least one existing room or another new room (sharing edges/corners)
- **RECTANGULAR ROOMS ONLY**: All rooms must be perfect rectangles with 90-degree corners
- **AVOID OVERLAPS**: Carefully check that new room boundaries don't intersect ALL existing rooms
- **MAINTAIN CONNECTIVITY**: Ensure all new rooms can be connected via doors to the existing layout
- **FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS**: Consider the room relationships and circulation patterns mentioned in the original request
- **COORDINATE FREEDOM**: Use ANY coordinate values including negative numbers (x < 0, y < 0) as needed - rooms are NOT required to be above (0,0)

BUILDING STYLE: {existing_layout_data.get('building_style', 'Modern functional architecture')}

STEP 4: ROOM PLACEMENT TASK
Following the analysis from Steps 1-3 above, add the specified rooms to the existing layout using rectangular vertices. Your placement must:

**FULFILL ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- Implement the specific functional requirements you identified for each room type
- Use the appropriate room sizes (compact/medium/large/spacious) as indicated in the original request
- Respect the connectivity and adjacency relationships described in the original user request
- Support the circulation patterns and privacy levels mentioned in the original design

**MAINTAIN DESIGN COHERENCE**:
- Follow the architectural style and design principles from the original request
- Ensure proper spatial relationships and functional adjacencies
- Create logical circulation flow that integrates with existing rooms
- Position rooms to support the overall design concept and usage patterns

**TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS**:
- No overlaps with existing rooms and ensure proper connectivity to avoid isolation
- Use perfect rectangular vertices for all new rooms
- Feel free to use negative coordinates (x < 0, y < 0) if they create better spatial arrangements

Respond with your thinking process and then a valid JSON object for the NEW ROOMS using this exact structure:

```json
{{
    "building_style": "description of architectural style",
    "rooms": [
        {{
            "room_type": "specific room type from the rooms to add list",
            "vertices": [
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}},
                {{"x": float, "y": float}}
            ],
            "height": float
        }}
    ]
}}
```

CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. **VERIFY ANALYSIS**: Confirm you have identified the specific requirements for each room from the original user request
2. **VERIFY REQUIREMENTS FULFILLMENT**: Ensure each new room meets the functional, size, and adjacency requirements from the original request
3. **CHECK OVERLAPS**: Verify no new room vertex is inside any existing room boundary
4. **CHECK ADJACENCY**: Verify each new room touches at least one existing room or another new room  
5. **CHECK RECTANGLES**: Verify all rooms have exactly 4 vertices forming perfect rectangles
6. **CHECK CONNECTIVITY**: Ensure new rooms support the circulation patterns described in the original request

🚨 FINAL REMINDER - THESE ARE MANDATORY 🚨
- **NO OVERLAPPING ROOMS**: Check that no new room vertices are inside existing rooms and no boundaries intersect
- **NO ISOLATED ROOMS**: Verify every new room can connect to existing layout
- **PERFECT RECTANGLES**: Every room must have exactly 4 vertices forming a rectangle with 90-degree corners
- **COORDINATE FLEXIBILITY**: Remember you can use ANY coordinates including negative values - optimal placement is more important than staying above (0,0)

Generate ONLY the new rooms that need to be added - do not repeat existing rooms."""

    # Construct the prompt for Claude to generate shapes and adjacency graph
    prompt = f"""You are an expert architect and interior designer. Analyze this description and generate room specifications and adjacency relationships: "{input_text}"

🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS 🚨
- Generate ONLY room shapes (rectangles) and adjacency connections
- NO overlapping rooms, NO isolated rooms
- Every room must connect to at least one other room

STEP 1: ANALYZE REQUEST TYPE
First determine if the user is asking for:
- SINGLE ROOM: Only one specific room (e.g., "design a living room", "create a bedroom", "generate a kitchen")
- MULTIPLE ROOMS: A complete layout, house, apartment, or multiple connected rooms

STEP 2: GENERATE ROOM SPECIFICATIONS AND ADJACENCY GRAPH
For SINGLE ROOM requests:
- Generate just that one room with appropriate dimensions
- Use realistic proportions for the specific room type
- No adjacency graph needed (single room)

For MULTIPLE ROOMS requests:
- Create functional room specifications with realistic dimensions
- Generate adjacency relationships ensuring connectivity
- Consider architectural best practices and room relationships
- Ensure every room is connected to at least one other room

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object using this exact structure:

```json
{{
    "building_style": "description of architectural style (e.g., Modern residential, Traditional colonial, etc.)",
    "shapes": [
        {{
            "room_type": "specific room type (e.g., living room, master bedroom, kitchen, etc.)",
            "width": float,
            "height": float
        }}
    ],
    "graph": {{
        "room_type_1": ["room_type_2", "room_type_3"],
        "room_type_2": ["room_type_1"],
        "room_type_3": ["room_type_1"]
    }}
}}
```

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- For SINGLE ROOM: Include exactly 1 room in "shapes" array, empty graph object {{}}
- For MULTIPLE ROOMS: Include all rooms in "shapes" array with proper adjacency in "graph"
- Use metric units (meters) for all dimensions
- Standard room dimensions: living room (4-6m x 5-7m), bedroom (3-4m x 4-5m), kitchen (3-4m x 3-5m), etc.
- Graph keys must exactly match room_type values in shapes array
- Ensure graph represents a connected structure (no isolated rooms)
- Room dimensions should be realistic for their intended function

Generate room specifications and adjacency graph that truly reflects the input description with appropriate room types, dimensions, and spatial relationships.

🚨 FINAL REMINDER 🚨
- **CONNECTED GRAPH**: Every room must be reachable from every other room
- **MATCHING NAMES**: Graph keys must exactly match room_type values in shapes
- **REALISTIC DIMENSIONS**: Use appropriate sizes for each room type"""

CONSTRAINTS:
- Entry door: width 0.8-1.2m, height 2.0-2.1m

{f"- Wide openings: width 1.2-3.0m, height 2.0-2.4m" if len(all_selected_doors) > 0 else ""}
- Windows: width 0.8-3.0m, height 0.8-2.0m, sill_height 0.3-1.2m
- Window grid: [nx, ny]  where nx=horizontal grid, ny=vertical grid
Examples:

"fixed": (1, 1),
"slider": (2, 1),  # 2 horizontal panes, 1 vertical
"hung": (1, 2),    # 1 horizontal pane, 2 vertical
"bay_small": (2, 2),
"bay_medium": (3, 2),
"bay_large": (3, 3),

- Window colors: Generate DISTINCT and CONTRASTING glass_color and frame_color as RGB values [0-255].
CRITICAL: Ensure high visual contrast between glass and frame colors - they must be easily distinguishable.
Colors should be consistent with the window appearance description.

  GLASS COLOR EXAMPLES (choose ONE type, ensure contrast with frame):
  * Clear Glass: [245, 250, 255] (bright clear), [250, 248, 240] (warm clear), [248, 252, 255] (cool clear)
  * Tinted Glass: [200, 230, 255] (light blue tint), [230, 245, 220] (light green tint), [255, 245, 220] (warm amber)
  * Privacy Glass: [220, 220, 220] (frosted white), [200, 210, 225] (frosted blue), [210, 200, 190] (frosted bronze)
  * Colored Glass: [150, 200, 255] (sky blue), [200, 255, 200] (mint green), [255, 220, 180] (warm amber)
  
  FRAME COLOR EXAMPLES (choose to CONTRAST with glass color):
  * Dark Frames: [40, 30, 20] (dark brown), [25, 25, 25] (charcoal black), [60, 40, 30] (dark walnut)
  * Light Frames: [250, 245, 235] (cream white), [240, 240, 240] (light gray), [245, 240, 225] (off-white)
  * Colored Frames: [120, 80, 60] (medium brown), [80, 100, 120] (blue-gray), [100, 120, 80] (sage green)
  * Metal Frames: [180, 180, 180] (brushed aluminum), [160, 140, 120] (bronze), [100, 100, 100] (gunmetal)

  CONTRAST GUIDELINES:
  * Light glass (245+) → Use dark frame (60 or below)
  * Dark/colored glass (200 or below) → Use light frame (200+) or contrasting color
  * Ensure at least 100+ difference in brightness between glass and frame RGB averages
- Position values are 0.0-1.0 (center of wall)

# DETAILED ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: 3-BEDROOM STUDENT APARTMENT

## FLOOR PLAN STRUCTURE & SPATIAL ORGANIZATION

Design a contemporary 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom student apartment with a **linear corridor circulation strategy** and dedicated entry planning. The floor plan consists of **multiple rectangular rooms** connected through a central hallway spine that ensures privacy while maintaining excellent connectivity between shared spaces.

**OVERALL LAYOUT PATTERN**: Linear arrangement with a central rectangular hallway room serving as the primary circulation spine, flanked by private bedrooms on one side and shared living spaces clustered on the other side. This creates clear separation between private study/sleeping areas and social/functional zones while maintaining efficient access to all spaces.

**BUILDING STYLE**: Modern functional design emphasizing practicality, natural light distribution, and flexible living arrangements suitable for undergraduate lifestyle patterns.

## ROOM CONNECTIVITY & CIRCULATION

**ENTRANCE STRATEGY**: The main entrance (standard width front door) opens into a **dedicated rectangular entry foyer room** (compact size) that serves as a transition zone and distribution point. This entry foyer connects directly to the main rectangular hallway room, creating a proper arrival sequence that prevents direct visual access into private areas while establishing clear circulation hierarchy.

**HALLWAY ROOM SYSTEM**: 
- **Main Hallway Room** (medium-length rectangular corridor): Positioned centrally, running lengthwise through the apartment. This rectangular hallway room connects the entry foyer to all major spaces and serves as the primary circulation spine.
- **Secondary Hallway Room** (compact rectangular connector): A shorter rectangular hallway room that branches from the main hallway to provide access to the kitchen and dining area, creating separation between circulation and food preparation activities.

**CIRCULATION HIERARCHY**:
- **Primary Route**: Entry foyer → Main hallway room → Individual bedrooms and shared bathroom
- **Secondary Route**: Main hallway room → Secondary hallway room → Kitchen and dining area
- **Tertiary Route**: Living room connects directly to main hallway room and secondary hallway room for flexible social circulation

## DETAILED ROOM SPECIFICATIONS

### ENTRY SPACES
**Entry Foyer Room** (compact rectangular room): Positioned at the apartment entrance, provides transition space with coat storage capability. Connects to main hallway room via standard interior door.

**Main Hallway Room** (medium-length rectangular corridor): Central circulation spine running lengthwise through the apartment. Connects entry foyer, all three bedrooms, shared bathroom, and living room. Positioned to provide efficient access while maintaining privacy separation.

**Secondary Hallway Room** (compact rectangular connector): Branches from main hallway room to access kitchen and dining areas. Creates functional separation between circulation and food service areas.

### PRIVATE SPACES
**Bedroom 1** (medium-sized rectangular room): Positioned at the far end of main hallway room for maximum privacy. Sized appropriately for single student occupancy with study area capability. Connected to main hallway room via standard interior door.

**Bedroom 2** (medium-sized rectangular room): Located mid-way along main hallway room, adjacent to Bedroom 1. Mirror layout to Bedroom 1 for consistency. Connected to main hallway room via standard interior door.

**Bedroom 3** (medium-sized rectangular room): Positioned closest to entry foyer along main hallway room. Slightly larger than other bedrooms to accommodate potential common storage. Connected to main hallway room via standard interior door.

### BATHROOM FACILITIES
**Master Bathroom** (medium-sized rectangular room): Full bathroom accessible from main hallway room, positioned centrally between bedrooms for equal access. Includes full bathing facilities and serves as primary bathroom for all residents.

**Powder Room** (compact rectangular room): Half-bath accessible from secondary hallway room near kitchen and dining areas. Provides convenient access during social gatherings and meal preparation without accessing private corridor areas.

### SHARED LIVING SPACES
**Living Room** (large rectangular room): Spacious social hub positioned at the intersection of main hallway room and secondary hallway room. Central location enables easy access from all bedrooms while serving as primary gathering space. Connected via wide openings to both hallway rooms for flexible circulation.

**Kitchen** (medium-sized rectangular galley room): Functional cooking space accessible from secondary hallway room. Positioned for efficient service to dining area while maintaining separation from main circulation. Connected to secondary hallway room via standard door and to dining area via wide opening.

**Dining Area** (medium-sized rectangular room): Dedicated eating space connected to kitchen via wide opening and to secondary hallway room via standard door. Positioned to enable social dining while maintaining connection to living areas.

## DOOR AND WINDOW PLACEMENT STRATEGY

### DOOR SPECIFICATIONS
- **Main Entrance**: Standard width exterior door opening into entry foyer room
- **Hallway Connections**: Standard interior doors connecting entry foyer to main hallway room, and main hallway room to secondary hallway room
- **Bedroom Access**: Each bedroom connected to main hallway room via standard interior doors positioned for privacy
- **Bathroom Access**: Master bathroom accessed from main hallway room; powder room accessed from secondary hallway room
- **Living Area Connections**: Living room connected via wide openings to both hallway rooms for flexible circulation
- **Kitchen/Dining**: Kitchen connected to secondary hallway room via standard door; kitchen to dining area via wide opening; dining area to secondary hallway room via standard door

### WINDOW STRATEGY
- **Each Bedroom**: One large window for natural light and ventilation, positioned for study area illumination
- **Living Room**: Multiple large windows on primary facade for maximum natural light and social atmosphere
- **Kitchen**: Medium window over work area for task lighting and ventilation
- **Dining Area**: Medium window for pleasant meal atmosphere and natural light
- **Bathrooms**: Small ventilation windows in master bathroom; powder room may utilize mechanical ventilation
- **Hallway Rooms**: Main hallway room includes one medium window at far end for natural light penetration; secondary hallway room relies on borrowed light from connected spaces

## ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT & FUNCTIONALITY

**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**: Layout supports independent student lifestyles while encouraging appropriate social interaction. Private bedrooms enable individual study and rest, while clustered shared spaces promote community building. Kitchen and dining areas sized for group meal preparation and shared dining experiences.

**PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS**: Hallway room system creates buffer zones between private bedrooms and shared spaces. Entry foyer prevents direct visual access into living areas from entrance. Bedroom positioning along main hallway room ensures equal privacy levels for all residents.

**DAILY USAGE PATTERNS**: Morning routines supported by efficient bathroom access from bedroom corridor. Study periods accommodated by private bedroom spaces with good natural light. Social activities centered in living room with easy kitchen access for entertaining. Meal preparation and dining areas positioned for both individual and group use.

**SERVICE ACCESS**: Kitchen positioned for efficient grocery delivery and waste management. Utility connections centralized near kitchen and bathroom areas. Storage opportunities integrated throughout hallway rooms and entry foyer for shared items and personal belongings.

This design creates an efficient, livable environment that balances the need for personal privacy with opportunities for social interaction, while the rectangular hallway room system ensures logical circulation and clear spatial organization suitable for undergraduate student living.
