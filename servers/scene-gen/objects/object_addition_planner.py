DOORS ({len(room.doors)}): {doors_text}
WINDOWS ({len(room.windows)}): {windows_text}
EXISTING OBJECTS ({len(room.objects)}): {existing_objects_text}

USER REQUEST: {condition.strip()}

TASK: Determine exactly ONE object to add based on the user's request, room type, available space, and existing objects.

PLACEMENT TARGET RULES:
- "floor": placing on the ground/floor (includes against walls, in corners, or anywhere on floor surface)
- "wall": ONLY for objects that are attached/mounted directly on the wall (like wall shelves, paintings, wall-mounted TVs)
- "object_id": placing onto/on top of a specific existing object

EXAMPLES:
- "add table against the wall" → "floor" (table sits on floor, positioned near wall)
- "add sofa to corner" → "floor" (sofa sits on floor in corner)
- "add picture on wall" → "wall" (picture is mounted on wall)
- "add lamp on table" → use table's object_id (lamp goes on top of table)
- "add picture on wall region that on top of the bed" → "wall" (picture is mounted on wall region that on top of the bed)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json

    "placement_guidance": "Spatial instructions from user condition: wall references, alignments, distance relationships, priorities",
    "justification": "Why this object was chosen"
}}
```

NAMING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use descriptive names: "wooden_office_chair", "glass_coffee_table", "ceramic_table_lamp"
- Description: Physical characteristics only, no function/purpose
- Must work for 3D generation: "A model of {{object_type.replace('_', ' ')}}, {{object_description}}"

VISUAL ANALYSIS:
Please examine the room layout image I've provided. This image shows:
- The room boundaries and walls (rendered background)
- Brown rectangles: Door openings and swing areas that must be kept clear
- Cyan rectangles: Windows that provide natural light
- Colored rectangles with arrows: Existing furniture objects already placed in the room
- White arrows: Show the facing direction of existing furniture (+Y = up, -Y = down, +X = right, -X = left)
- Grid lines: Help with spatial understanding (each grid square represents distance)
- Text labels: Show object IDs for reference in constraints
- Coordinate system: (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner, x is right, y is up

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- The room layout uses a coordinate system where (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner
- All measurements are in centimeters
- Grid points show possible placement locations

CONSTRAINT SYSTEM:
Available constraints:

1. GLOBAL CONSTRAINT (required):
   - edge: Place close to walls/room perimeter (when user requests wall placement, corner placement, or object needs wall support)
   - middle: Place in central/interior area of room (when user requests central placement, or object needs all-around access)

2. DISTANCE CONSTRAINTS (only if explicitly mentioned in user guidance):
   - near, [object_id]: Place near another object (50cm-150cm distance)
   - far, [object_id]: Place far from another object (150cm+ distance)

3. POSITION CONSTRAINTS (relative to target object's facing direction, NOT the visualization):
   - in front of, [object_id]: Position in front of another object (in the direction it faces)
   - around, [object_id]: Position around another object (typically for chairs around tables)
   - side of, [object_id]: Position to the left or right side of another object
   - left of, [object_id]: Position to the LEFT of another object (relative to its facing direction)
   - right of, [object_id]: Position to the RIGHT of another object (relative to its facing direction)
   
   IMPORTANT: "left", "right", and "front" are relative to the TARGET OBJECT'S facing direction (shown by white arrows), 
   NOT the absolute directions in the visualization. For example, if a chair faces +Y direction and you want to place 
   a table "in front of" it, the table should be placed in the +Y direction from the chair.

4. ALIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS:
   - center aligned, [object_id]: Align centers with another object

5. ROTATION CONSTRAINTS:
   - face to, [object_id]: Orient to face toward another object's center

CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS APPROACH:
Analyze the user's specific request and object placement guidance to determine constraints:

1. SPATIAL KEYWORDS IN USER REQUEST:
   - Look for explicit spatial instructions: "against wall", "corner", "center", "middle", "between objects", etc.
   - Pay attention to relative positioning: "near window", "close to door", "away from bed", etc.
   - IMPORTANT: Only add distance constraints (near/far) when explicitly mentioned in the user's guidance

2. CONTEXTUAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Consider the specific function described in the user's request
   - Consider interaction patterns mentioned in the guidance
   - Consider the room layout and existing furniture arrangement

3. CONSTRAINT SELECTION:
   - "edge": Choose when user mentions wall placement, corner placement, or when the specific context suggests perimeter positioning
   - "middle": Choose when user mentions central placement, between objects, or when the specific context suggests interior positioning
   - AVOID defaulting based on object type - the same object type can be placed differently based on user intent
   - DO NOT add distance constraints (near/far) unless the user explicitly mentions distance relationships in their condition

TASK:
Based on the visual room layout, object placement guidance, and the constraint analysis above, provide BOTH a suggested position and optimal constraints.

Please respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

```json
{{
    "success": true,
    "suggested_position": {{
        "x": center_x_coordinate_in_cm,
        "y": center_y_coordinate_in_cm
    }},
    "constraints": [
        "constraint_1",
        "constraint_2",
        "constraint_3"
    ],
    "placement_reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this position and constraints are optimal based on what you see in the image",
    "design_strategy": "Brief explanation of the overall design approach for this object"
}}
```

GUIDELINES:
1. Suggested position should be your best estimate of where the object center should be placed
2. Constraints should support and refine this placement decision
3. Work around existing objects - they cannot be moved
4. Use exact object IDs as shown in the image labels for constraints
5. Consider door swing areas and traffic flow paths
6. ANALYZE THE USER'S SPECIFIC REQUEST to choose constraints - avoid assumptions based on object type alone
7. NOTE: The current system only supports "edge" (near walls) or "middle" (central area) - choose based on the user's specific guidance and spatial requirements

CONSTRAINT FORMAT:
- First constraint must be either "edge" or "middle" (global constraint)
- Additional constraints should follow the format: "constraint_type, object_id" where applicable

EXAMPLES (context-dependent):
- User says "wardrobe against the right wall near window": {{"constraints": ["edge", "near, window-3", "far, bed_abc123"]}}
- User says "coffee table in front of sofa": {{"constraints": ["middle", "in front of, sofa_abc123", "center aligned, sofa_abc123"]}}
- User says "reading chair in the corner": {{"constraints": ["edge", "far, door-1", "near, window-2"]}}
- User says "chair around the dining table": {{"constraints": ["middle", "around, table_xyz789"]}}

SYSTEM LIMITATION NOTE: 
The current system only supports binary "edge" (near walls) vs "middle" (central) positioning. Ideally, a gradient system with options like "edge"/"intermediate"/"middle" would provide more nuanced placement, but you must choose between the two available options based on which better matches the user's specific request.

IMPORTANT: In your placement_reasoning, explain why you chose "edge" vs "middle" based specifically on the user's guidance and spatial requirements, not general object type assumptions.
