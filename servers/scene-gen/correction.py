   CORRECTION GUIDELINES:

   - Doors should be placed on shared walls between rooms that need to connect
   - Entry doors should provide access from main circulation areas (hallways, foyers)
   - Windows should be placed on exterior walls for natural light and views
   - Door positions (position_on_wall) must be recalculated for new room layouts
   - Window positions should optimize natural light distribution
   - WALL BOUNDARY COMPLIANCE: Ensure doors/windows fit completely within wall boundaries
   - NO OVERLAPS: Doors and windows on same wall must not overlap with each other
   - SPACING: Leave adequate space between doors and windows on same wall (minimum 0.3m)
   - Ensure all position_on_wall values are between 0.0 and 1.0
   - Calculate proper positioning: (start_pos + element_width) must be ≤ wall_length

ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS: "{original_input}"

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS:{issues_analysis}{door_window_corrections}

CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. ✅ ELIMINATE OVERLAPS: Reposition rooms so no two rooms occupy the same space
2. ✅ ENSURE CONNECTIVITY: All rooms must be connected through shared walls
3. ✅ MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY: Keep the same room types and similar sizes as requested
4. ✅ LOGICAL ADJACENCIES: Place rooms in architecturally sensible arrangements
5. ✅ REALISTIC PROPORTIONS: Use practical dimensions for each room type
6. ✅ CORRECT DOOR PLACEMENT: Update door positions to connect repositioned rooms logically
7. ✅ OPTIMIZE WINDOW PLACEMENT: Position windows appropriately for natural light and views

CORRECTION STRATEGY:
- For overlapping rooms: Reposition them to adjacent locations with shared walls
- For detached rooms: Move them to connect with the main building footprint
- Update door positions to provide logical access between connected rooms
- Place doors on shared walls between rooms that need circulation
- Position windows on exterior walls for optimal natural light
- Recalculate door/window position_on_wall values for new room layouts
- Maintain the overall intent of the original design

CRITICAL DOOR & WINDOW GUIDELINES:
- COMPLETE REPLACEMENT: Generate entirely new door/window layouts, replacing all existing ones
- Doors between connected rooms should be on shared walls
- Entry/exit doors should connect to circulation spaces (hallways, foyers)
- Bedroom doors should provide privacy while maintaining access
- Kitchen/dining areas should have logical flow connections
- Windows should be on exterior walls (not shared interior walls)
- Window placement should consider views and natural light distribution
- WALL BOUNDARY COMPLIANCE: All doors/windows must fit within their wall boundaries
- NO OVERLAPPING: Doors and windows on same wall must have clear separation (min 0.3m gap)
- PROPER SIZING: Doors 0.7-1.0m wide, windows 0.8-2.0m wide, positioned correctly within walls
- POSITIONING MATH: For element at position P on wall of length L with width W: P*L + W ≤ L

ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS: "{original_input}"

🚨 AGGRESSIVE CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. ✅ REMOVE PROBLEMATIC ROOMS: Eliminate rooms causing persistent overlaps or detachment
2. ✅ PRESERVE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS: Keep core rooms (living, kitchen, bedrooms, main bathroom)
3. ✅ ELIMINATE ALL OVERLAPS: No rooms can occupy the same space
4. ✅ ENSURE CONNECTIVITY: All remaining rooms must be connected via shared walls
5. ✅ REMOVE PROBLEMATIC DOORS/WINDOWS: Delete doors/windows that can't be properly placed
6. ✅ MAINTAIN LIVABILITY: Resulting layout must still be functional for daily life

REMOVAL STRATEGY:
- Start with LOWEST IMPORTANCE rooms (utility, storage, extra bathrooms)
- Remove rooms causing the MOST OVERLAPS first
- Eliminate DETACHED rooms that can't be easily connected
- Remove doors/windows that have placement issues
- Keep ESSENTIAL rooms: living areas, kitchen, primary bedroom, main bathroom
- Ensure remaining rooms form a CONNECTED, LIVABLE layout

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
- Remove UP TO {removal_strategy['max_rooms_to_remove']} rooms if necessary
- DO NOT remove living room, kitchen, or primary bedroom unless absolutely critical
- Remove doors/windows that have invalid positions or cause issues
- Recalculate door/window positions for remaining rooms
- Ensure final layout has NO overlaps and NO detached rooms

ORIGINAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS: "{original_input}"
{layout_summary}{issues_analysis}

🔧 DOOR/WINDOW CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS:
1. ✅ WALL BOUNDARY COMPLIANCE: All doors/windows must fit completely within their wall boundaries
2. ✅ NO OVERLAPS: Doors and windows on same wall must not overlap - maintain minimum 0.3m separation
3. ✅ PROPER POSITIONING: Calculate positions to ensure: position_on_wall * wall_length + element_width ≤ wall_length
4. ✅ COMPLETE REPLACEMENT: Generate entirely new door/window layouts, replacing all existing placements
5. ✅ MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY: Preserve door connectivity and window natural light purposes
6. ✅ STANDARD SIZING: Use appropriate dimensions (doors: 0.7-1.0m, windows: 0.8-2.0m)

POSITIONING CALCULATIONS:
- For wall of length L meters and element of width W meters at position P (0.0-1.0):
- Element occupies: P*L to (P*L + W) along the wall
- MUST ENSURE: P*L + W ≤ L (element fits within wall)
- For multiple elements on same wall: ensure no overlaps with minimum 0.3m gaps

CLEANUP STRATEGY:
- Replace ALL existing door/window positions with new, properly calculated ones
- Ensure doors provide logical room connections (on shared walls)
- Place windows on exterior walls for natural light
- Distribute elements evenly along walls to avoid overcrowding
- Maintain architectural logic while fixing placement issues
